# Game Setup UI Project Structure

This document provides an overview of the Game Setup UI project structure, explaining how components fit together, how data flows through the application, and thoughts on backend API design.


## Main Components

1. App.tsx: The main component that orchestrates the entire application. It manages the current page state and renders the appropriate components based on the user's progress.

2. Layout: A wrapper component that provides a consistent layout for the application.

3. StepProgress: Displays the user's progress through the setup process.

4. SelectMap: Allows users to choose a map for their game.

5. EditCharacter: Enables users to create and edit characters.

6. MultiSelectModal: A modal component for selecting multiple characters.

7. SpriteSelectionModal: A modal for choosing character sprites.

8. SelectMusic: Lets users pick background music for their game.


## Data Flow

The application uses React's state management to handle data flow. The main state is managed in App.tsx, which includes:

- currentPage: Determines which component to render
- selectedMap: Stores the ID of the selected map
- selectedCharacter: Stores the ID of the selected character
- selectedMusic: Stores the ID of the selected music

These state variables are passed down to child components as props. Child components can update the state using setter functions also passed as props.


## Styling

The project uses a combination of global styles and component-specific CSS:

- global.css: Contains base styles and variables for the pixel art theme
- Component-specific CSS files: Handle layout and styling for individual components

The styling approach uses CSS variables for easy theming and maintenance.


## API Design Thoughts

While the backend is not yet implemented, we've considered the necessary API endpoints for the application. Here are some potential API endpoints and their purposes:

1. Maps
  - GET /api/maps: Retrieve a list of all available maps
  - GET /api/maps/{id}: Get details of a specific map

2. Characters
  - GET /api/characters: Fetch all characters
  - GET /api/characters/{id}: Get details of a specific character
  - POST /api/characters: Create a new character
  - PUT /api/characters/{id}: Update an existing character
  - DELETE /api/characters/{id}: Delete a character

3. Music
  - GET /api/music: Retrieve a list of all available music tracks
  - GET /api/music/{id}: Get details of a specific music track

4. Game Setup
  - POST /api/game-setup: Save the complete game setup (selected map, character, and music)
  - GET /api/game-setup/{id}: Retrieve a saved game setup

These API endpoints are designed to support the current functionality of the Game Setup UI. They follow RESTful principles and provide a clear structure for future backend development.

In the frontend code, we've left placeholders for these API calls. For example, in EditCharacter.tsx:

// import { fetchCharacters, createCharacter, updateCharacter, deleteCharacter } from '../api/characters'

This approach allows for easy integration with the backend once it's developed, while still enabling the frontend to function with mock data in the meantime.


## Future Expansion

The project is structured to allow for easy expansion:

1. New Setup Steps: Additional setup steps can be added by creating new components in the features/ directory and updating the App.tsx component to include them in the flow.

2. API Integration: The project includes placeholder comments for API calls. These can be replaced with actual API calls when a backend is available.

3. Additional Customization: The character editor can be expanded to include more customization options, such as character skills or equipment.

4. Map Editor: A future feature could include a map editor, allowing users to create and customize their own maps.

5. Localization: The project can be expanded to support multiple languages by implementing a localization system.

6. State Management: As the application grows, consider implementing a more robust state management solution like Redux or Context API.

7. Backend Development: Implement the designed API endpoints and connect them to a database to make the application fully functional.
